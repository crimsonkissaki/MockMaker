    "description": "Whether you call them doubles, stubs, mocks, partials, fakes, or something else there are times when a mocking library such as PHPUnit's mockBuilder, Mockery, Prophecy, etc. just doesn't do exactly what you need or want. Sometimes you just need a concrete class implementation to run through the unit test wringer or a full end to end functional unit test suite. MockMaker aims to simplify the process of generating concrete fake ORM entity objects. Flexible and extendable, the generated seed code can be altered to suit your particular project with relative ease. That means after the initial setup you can re-run MockMaker for any new entities that get added in or update existing entities that change with little to no fuss. What's more, once MockMaker has made your files it's done; you don't have to include it in your code base and can use the generated files like any other project class.",
