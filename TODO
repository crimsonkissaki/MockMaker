MockMaker:

    allow for multiple (in|ex)clude regex strings?

    use setters of properties to check for additional typehints to set property default values

    add custom use statements that will be included in mock files
    - e.g. a custom debugger/mock manager
    - covered if/when custom templates work...
    
    finish custom file templates & datapoint worker functionality
    
    
FileGenerator:

    Is it possible to automatically include mock calls for known classes?
    - this might require analyzing the ORM annotations ...
    - have to include auto-detect + override ... or custom implementation?


ArgumentWorker:

    There are some values that cannot be obtained unless the PHP version is high enough:
    - do I want to mess with these?
    - need to investigate how these are used and WHY you'd want them.
    - or i could just add them BIC
        php >= 5.4
            isCallable()
            isDefaultValueConstant()
            getDefaultValueConstantName()
        php >= 5.6
            isVariadic()	-> function sum(...$numbers) {} -> elipsis indicated method overloading


BUGS:

    test to be sure that 'ignoreDirectoryStructure()' works as intended

    no good error checking when files return empty code strings
    - why did a mock fail?

    change testentitycode.txt to a php file with correct date


Investigation:

    set up MM to use a "Batch" system
    - batches get similar parameters to the current workflow, but it allows separation between mocks/ut/whatever else I decide to put in here
    - hinges on the current datapoint/template worker interaction to function
    
    ORM aware property analysis
    - will probably have to have this customizable/extendable as well
